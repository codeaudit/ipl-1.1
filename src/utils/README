The utils directory contains utility/test programs for VPF and DEM datafiles.

vpftableprint prints the contents of any VPF table.  Its one argument is a
table pathname.  For example:

	vpftableprint/$CPU/a.out /cdrom/dcw/browse/po/txt.

vfpdbprint prints the contents of a VPF database.  Its one argument is a
database pathname.  For example:

	vpfdbprint/$CPU/a.out /cdrom/dcw

dcwdemprint and usgsdemprint print out the contents of DCW DEM and
USGS 1 degree and 7.5 minute DEM files.  Their one argument is an
appropriate DEM file pathname.

usgsdem2vtk converts a USGS 1 degree DEM into a format importable by demviewer
while performing tiling and decimation to reduce data size.  Its arguments
are the DEM file pathname and the pathname of a directory where the tiled
files will be created (directory must exist before running.)  For example:

	usgsdem2vtk/$CPU/a.out san_francisco_e.dem.gz /data/sfe
